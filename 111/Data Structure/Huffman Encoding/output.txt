I mainly used the Apple's Official iOS UI Kit but also pulled elements from the tvOS, macOS and watchOS UI kits to achieve the homogenous redesign I aimed to build. I wanted the Music app to not only feel intertwined with iOS 13, but also the Apple ecosystem as a whole, such that you could move between hardware and software and feel unity, not just between apps within iOS. I also cleaned up some tiny things like the positioning of the divider between the navigation menu and its glyphs as the composition looked slightly off. A couple pixels nudged upwards did the trick. Yes, I was meticulous about every single text pt size, divider pixel position and element opacity. The perfectionist in me jumped out. High levels of detail and accuracy were extremely important to me, down to every individual letter I typed out for a song title.
